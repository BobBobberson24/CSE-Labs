# CSE-Labs

these are my labs and assignments for fall 2022 CSE1321L Java for anyone to look at for whatever reason. Keep in mind my solution isn't necessarily the most clean/efficient solution (in most cases it isn't). It's still a good starting point for anyone looking to create cleaner code since the professors don't exactly teach good practices but you should still take anything here with a grain of salt



I'll probably do them in C++ and possible C#


I was too lazy to comment anything so let me know if you have any questions or comment requests
